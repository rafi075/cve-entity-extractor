vulnerability was found in Perl. This security issue occurs while Perl for Windows relies on the system path environment variable to find the shell (`cmd.exe`). When running an executable that uses the Windows Perl interpreter, Perl attempts to find and execute `cmd.exe` within the operating system. However, due to path search order issues, Perl initially looks for cmd.exe in the current working directory. This flaw allows an attacker with limited privileges to place`cmd.exe` in locations with weak permissions, such as `C:\\ProgramData`. By doing so, arbitrary code can be executed when an administrator attempts to use this executable from these compromised locations.","Published Date":"1\/2\/2024","CVSS Version

Starting in version 0.5.0 and prior to version 0.12.0, an issue in the `FamStructWrapper::deserialize` implementation provided by the crate for `vmm_sys_util::fam::FamStructWrapper` can lead to out of bounds memory accesses. The deserialization does not check that the length stored in the header matches the flexible array length. Mismatch in the lengths might allow out of bounds memory access through Rust-safe methods. The issue was corrected in version 0.12.0 by inserting a check that verifies the lengths of compared flexible arrays are equal for any deserialized header and aborting deserialization otherwise. Moreover, the API was changed so that header length can only be modified through Rust-unsafe code. This ensures that users cannot trigger out-of-bounds memory access from Rust-safe code.","Published Date":"1\/2\/2024","CVSS Version

In `rust-evm`, a feature called `record_external_operation` was introduced, allowing library users to record custom gas changes. This feature can have some bogus interactions with the call stack. In particular, during finalization of a `CREATE` or `CREATE2`, in the case that the substack execution happens successfully, `rust-evm` will first commit the substate, and then call `record_external_operation(Write(out_code.len()))`. If `record_external_operation` later fails, this error is returned to the parent call stack, instead of `Succeeded`. Yet, the substate commitment already happened. This causes smart contracts able to commit state changes, when the parent caller contract receives zero address (which usually indicates that the execution has failed). This issue only impacts library users with custom `record_external_operation` that returns errors. The issue is patched in release 0.41.1. No known workarounds are available.","Published Date":"1\/2\/2024","CVSS Version 3.x":7.5},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-03-13T11:21:23.220667Z","updated_at":"2024-03-21T00:29:29.440274Z","inner_id":49,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":7,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":50,"annotations":[{"id":71,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":24,"text":"omniauth-microsoft_graph","labels":["Software"]},"id":"4bRUj93Cy6","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":63,"end":72,"text":"Microsoft","labels":["Vendor"]},"id":"A7dbEjpzim","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":84,"end":107,"text":"Prior to versions 2.0.0","labels":["Software Version"]},"id":"dtNTkCR75r","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":109,"end":240,"text":"the implementation did not validate the legitimacy of the `email` attribute of the user nor did it give\/document an option to do so","labels":["Reason"]},"id":"bsKQ-jN1S3","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":355,"end":391,"text":"This could lead to account takeover.","labels":["Consequences"]},"id":"lahk_yKqir","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":167,"end":184,"text":"`email` attribute","labels":["Source"]},"id":"d45peiFrok","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":267,"end":353,"text":"nOAuth misconfiguration in cases when the `email` is used as a trusted user identifier","labels":["Trigger"]},"id":"jFEQCuK6vy","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-03-20T23:36:58.497674Z","updated_at":"2024-03-20T23:38:56.546694Z","draft_created_at":"2024-03-20T23:36:53.306215Z","lead_time":147.768,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"b47a0980-3895-4415-ab15-7d752bee07e8","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":50,"project":7,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"08afc946-CVE-NER-Dataset.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"ID":"CVE-2024-21632","Description":"omniauth-microsoft_graph provides an Omniauth strategy for the Microsoft Graph API. Prior to versions 2.0.0, the implementation did not validate the legitimacy of the `email` attribute of the user nor did it give\/document an option to do so, making it susceptible to nOAuth misconfiguration in cases when the `email` is used as a trusted user identifier.
