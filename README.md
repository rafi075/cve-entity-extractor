# cve-entity-extractor : Gen-AI techniques to extract  pre-defined Entity information
This work aims at extracting pre-define secuity attributes from vulnerability (CVE) dataset.https://www.cve.org.
As the dataset contains 'Text' of explaining secuirty vulnerabilities, we wanted to leverage the power of language models. 
We wanted to intervene at two stages:
- Training phase (Finetuning)
- Inference stage (Prompt Engineering)

In both cases, we targeted ***Question-Answer*  method to extract information.

## Fine Tuning
We have tried to fine tune Transformer model (BERT), Short Language Model (Phi-2) and Large Language Model (Llama-2)
- BERT : We have used supervised learning by fine tuning with annotated dataset
- Phi-2 : We have used unspervised learning but 'Incorporating INS into train-data'
- Llama-2: We have used unspervised learning but 'Incorporating INS into train-data'

## Prompt Engineering via openAI APIs
We have used **batch API** to execute bulk requests

- Zero Shot learning: Build request with no example
- One Shot learning: Build request with one example
